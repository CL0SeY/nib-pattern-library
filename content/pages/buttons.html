## Primary

-	Main call to action 
-	Should be used sparingly
    -	Can be used multiple times on a page when it performs the same action e.g. licking to quote on landing pages or selecting a product in Quote test
        -	Homepage is a current example that breaks this rule
-	Can be used with an icon e.g. New join indicating a step in the process

### Example

    <button class="v2-button v2-button--primary">Click me!</button>

    <button class="v2-button v2-button--primary">Click me!</button>
</section>


## Supplementary

-	Used in conjunction with primary call to action when the user has a choice between one or more options (including the primary) e.g. New Join pages
    -	Indicates clear hierarchy of actions
-	Not usually used with an icon

## Secondary

-	Still clearly a button but less prominent than primary. 
    -	This lack of prominence should indicate a hierarchy
    -	Can also be used as the only CTA on a page e.g. Close button on extras product pages
-	Can be used with an icon e.g. chevron on quote test or X on Extras product pages

## Tertiary

-	Most common/numerous of button styles
-	Can be used with an icon
